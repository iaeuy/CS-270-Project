# CS-270-Project
Spectral graph theory and applications.
Albert Zheng and Cory Cheung.

In class, we saw that the spectral gap can be used to study graphs. The goal of our project was to learn about further extensions of these results. 

`spectral_graph_theory.pdf` - the report on our findings. This includes an explanation of the math behind the spectral gap and spectral graph drawing problem. We also describe our experiments with the spectral graph drawing and spectral graph clustering (for image segmentation) algorithms.

`main.py` - the code used for image segmentation

`spectral_drawing_examples.sagews` - the Sage worksheet used for spectral graph drawing. This worksheet and the output graph drawings can also be found on the Sage Cloud at https://cloud.sagemath.com/projects/e45ac699-fb28-448e-b028-64e92b88e0fa/files/spectral_drawing_examples.sagews
